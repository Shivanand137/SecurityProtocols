# Security Protocols
Learning different types of security protocols widely used in the industry.

1. JWT
2. OAuth 2.0
3. OpenIdConnect

This repository contains different APIs created using ASP.NET Core. The API contacts a fake JSON Placeholder Server and fetches todos. The user can get all todos, get todos by user id, get a single todo, add, update and delete todos. A call to the JSONPlaceholder API is being done using the internal HTTPClient service.

JSONPlaceholder: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

I've added a new folder called "POSTMAN-Collections", which has a collection of POSTMAN client - API requests. Download that and import it into postman to test the API.
